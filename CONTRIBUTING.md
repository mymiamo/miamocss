# Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing to the Miamo CSS Library! Here’s how you can help improve the project.

## Contribution Process

1. **Fork** the repository and clone it to your local machine.
2. Start by making changes or adding new features.
3. Ensure that any new code fits into an existing file category. (New files should generally be avoided.)
4. Submit a **Pull Request** with a clear description of your changes.
5. Approved changes will be documented and published on [https://css.mymiamo.net/](https://css.mymiamo.net/).

## File Guidelines

- New files should only be added if absolutely necessary.
- New features should be added within the relevant file and clearly commented with what the feature does.

## Testing

Tests are not required, but it’s highly appreciated if you test your changes locally before contributing. It helps improve the project for everyone.

## Design Guidelines

The design should follow a modern, minimalist approach, adhering to the following principles:

- **Transparency (Backdrop-filter)** and light **blur effects** to create a clean, elegant appearance.
- **Box-shadow** and **border-radius** values should be soft and rounded.
- **Hover** states should have subtle and smooth animations (transform, transition) to create a fluid interaction.
- Buttons and components should feel user-friendly, slightly scaling or shifting to the left when interacted with.
- **Readability** should be prioritized, with medium-weight, clean, and sleek typography.
- The design should evoke transparency and fluidity, avoiding harsh lines and sharp corners.
